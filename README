****** Quick start ******
All you need to do is add this to the HTML you serve to your visitors:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/A1kmm/donttrackem/raw/
master/donttrackem.min.js"></script>
In your Javascript, after the page is loaded, you need to call optOutOfAll() -
if you don't have any other Javascript, you can just put onload="optOutOfAll()"
as an attribute on the <body> tag.
****** How it works ******
Advertisers put advertising on users' pages by asking content providers to
include their script, image, or iframe tags in a page; the end result is that
when a user visits the site hosting the content, they also make requests to
servers owned by the advertising network. These servers will often set a cookie
to track the user; this allows large advertising networks to see the pattern of
sites a user visits and is served advertisements on.
There has been talk for a long time of regulatory measures to stop tracking, or
provide a mandatory opt-out ability. To prevent this, many advertising networks
provide a mechanism to allow users to opt-out from being tracked, so they can
say 'look, we are self-regulating, there is no need to pass any laws'.
Many users don't know that they are being tracked, so won't know to opt-out.
This is where donttrackme comes in. Donttrackme is a small Javascript file you
can include in your website to ensure that anyone who visits your website won't
be tracked by certain advertising networks. It works by using the opt-out
mechanism on a long list of sites. Your users don't need to do anything; many
of them won't notice any difference, because they didn't know they were being
tracked before, but you will be doing your bit behind the scenes to protect
their privacy.
donttrackem firstly loads an image (which is not displayed to the user, so is
invisible) off an advertising network site which changes size to indicate if a
user has already blocked tracking for that site. If they have, donttrackem
assumes it doesn't need to do anything, and it stops there. This helps save
bandwidth for repeat visitors to your site.
If the user doesn't already have tracking blocked for that network, it puts an
image with the URL for disabling tracking for 141 different networks, again not
visible to your user (except perhaps as sites loading in the status bar). These
images load quietly in the background, usually without interfering with the
experience of your site at all (it may slow down loading your images slightly;
you could wait until your site has loaded before calling optOutOfAll() if this
is likely to be a problem).
****** Q&amp;A ******
      Won't this discourage networks from providing an opt-out feature?
  Probably not, because they are doing this to reduce the chances of being
  regulated.
      Could advertising networks block this?
  There are several ways they could stop this script from working if they
  really wanted to. It would probably be a lot harder to re-enable tracking for
  your users who are already opted out, however, if they can't separate them
  from people who deliberately opted out. This is a good reason to encourage as
  many sites as possible to deploy the script.
      How many networks are blocked?
  141.
      What about other networks?
  Unfortunately, other networks will still be able to track your users; tell
  your legislators to enact stronger privacy laws.
      Is there any guarantee or warranty?
  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, DONTTRACKEM COMES
  WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY FORM WHATSOEVER, NOT EVEN A GUARANTEE OF FITNESS FOR
  PURPOSE.
      What is the license / Copyright situation for donttrackem?
  The author irrevocably places this work in the public domain, or where that
  is not possible, grants a license to use, modify, and distribute it for any
  purpose.
      Could advertising networks use this to track my users?
  If they wanted to be really evil, and use an anti-tracking opt-out URL as a
  tracking mechanism, then yes. However, we picked one advertising network
  ('AdBrite') as an indicator to let the script know if it has already been
  run; this will get a hit every page load, while all other networks should
  only get one hit per user ever.
      Can advertising networks use this script to display advertising on my
      pages without my permission?
  No (save by exploiting a browser bug, anyway), because only images are loaded
  from their sites.
      What files make up donttrackem?
  This file, README.html. donttrackem.js, containing the source.
  donttrackem.min.js, containing the minified source (the best one to include).
